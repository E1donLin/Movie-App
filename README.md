# Movie Web: https://affectionate-curran-856664.netlify.app

#### The purpose of this project is to practice React.js and API fetching.

This website uses the Movie API from themoviedb.org. This API has the data of tens of thousands of movies, in this app you can see the recent trending movies and you can search movies by genre or by the name.

## Familiarized myself with:
* React.js Hooks (State/Effect)
* Asynchronous API (async/await)
* JSX, components, props, css modules, etc.

(React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/Material-UI, deployed with Netlify)
